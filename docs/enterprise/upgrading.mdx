## How to: Upgrade to Weave Gitops Enterprise

Upgrading requires we:

1. Have a cluster with Weave GitOps installed
2. Apply the entitlements secret
3. Upgrade
4. Configure
5. Check that Weave Gitops Enterprise has been installed
6. Connect the management cluster up to itself

### 1. Install `gitops` on a new cluster

We'll use `kind` here as an example.

- The `extraMounts` are for the Docker CAPI provider (CAPD)
- `extraPortMappings` are for easily accessing NATS and the UI

```yaml title="kind-config.yaml"
kind: Cluster
apiVersion: kind.x-k8s.io/v1alpha4
nodes:
  - role: control-plane
    extraMounts:
      - hostPath: /var/run/docker.sock
        containerPath: /var/run/docker.sock
    extraPortMappings:
      - containerPort: 30080
        hostPort: 30080
        listenAddress: "0.0.0.0" # Optional, defaults to "0.0.0.0"
        protocol: tcp # Optional, defaults to tcp
      - containerPort: 31490
        hostPort: 31490
        listenAddress: "0.0.0.0" # Optional, defaults to "0.0.0.0"
        protocol: tcp # Optional, defaults to tcp
```

Fire up cluster

```bash
kind create cluster --config kind-config.yaml
```

Create a new repo

```bash
gh repo create my-management-cluster --private --confirm
cd my-management-cluster
echo "# my-management-cluster" > README.md
git add README.md
git commit --all --message "init commit"
git push -u

```

Install Weave Gitops

```bash
gitops install --app-config-url $(git config --get remote.origin.url)
```

### 2. Apply the entitlements secret

Contact sales@weave.works for a valid entitlements secret. Then apply it to the cluster:

```bash
kubectl apply -f entitlements.yaml
```

### 3. Upgrade

:::note Make sure `GITHUB_TOKEN` is set

`GITHUB_TOKEN` should be set as an environment variable in the current shell. It should have permissions to create Pull Requests against the cluster config repo

:::

Run the upgrade command from a local copy of git repo that is sync'd to the cluster:

```bash
gitops upgrade --profile-version 0.0.15 --app-config-url $(git config --get remote.origin.url)
```

A **Pull Request** will be created against your cluster repository. **Review and merge** this pull request to upgrade to Weave Gitops Enterprise.

### 4. Configure Weave Gitops Enterprise

Weave Gitops Enterprise has a number of configration options but two importants aspect to configure are:

#### 4.1. Ingress

An Ingress address is necessary in order to establish connectivity between agents and your WGE instance. The way to determine this depends on your cluster type and provisioning method.

<Tabs
  groupId="agent-ingress"
  values={[
    { label: "kind clusters", value: "kind-clusters" },
    { label: "Other cloud providers", value: "other-clusters" },
  ]}
>
  <TabItem value="kind-clusters" default>

To determine the public IP address of the worker nodes of your cluster get the local IP for kind:

```bash
export INGRESS_ADDRESS=$(ipconfig getifaddr en0)
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="other-clusters">

For other cluster providers you'll have to configure the ingress around what they provide.

```bash
export INGRESS_ADDRESS=wge.example.com
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Update the `agentTemplate.natsURL` value in the Weave Gitops Enterprise `ConfigMap` in your config repo.

### 5. Checking that WGE is installed

You should now be able to load the WGE UI:

<Tabs
  groupId="check-installation"
  values={[
    { label: "kind clusters", value: "kind-clusters" },
    { label: "Other cloud providers", value: "other-clusters" },
  ]}
>
  <TabItem value="kind-clusters" default>

If you've created a `kind` cluster using the config above, head to [http://localhost:30080](http://localhost:30080) to view the UI.

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="other-clusters">

For other cluster providers you can port forward to quickly test things are working

```bash
$ kubectl port-forward --namespace wego-system deployments.apps/mccp-nginx-ingress-controller 8000:80
```

The WGE UI should now be accessible at [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000).

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### 6. Connect the management cluster up to itself

_Connecting a cluster_ installs the agent which is responsible for detecting new clusters and reporting their status to the UI. We need to install the agent on our newly created management cluster. Check out [How to: Connect a cluster](../cluster-management/managing-existing-clusters.mdx#how-to-connect-a-cluster).

Head over to [Getting started](../cluster-management/getting-started.mdx) to create your first CAPI Cluster.
