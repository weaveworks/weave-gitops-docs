## How to: Upgrade to Weave Gitops Enterprise

Upgrading requires we:

1. Already have Weave GitOps [installed on the cluster](../getting-started.md)
2. Install Profiles onto the cluster
3. Apply the entitlements secret
4. Upgrade
5. Configure
6. Check that Weave Gitops Enterprise has been installed

### 2. Install profiles

:::note This step will be removed

This step will be removed when Profiles are included in Weave Gitops

:::

Download the latest `pctl` [release](https://github.com/weaveworks/pctl/releases) and install the Profile custom resources:

```bash
pctl install --flux-namespace wego-system
```

### 3. Apply the entitlements secret

Contact sales@weave.works for a valid entitlements secret. Then apply it to the cluster:

```bash
kubectl apply -f entitlements.yaml
```

### 4. Upgrade

Run the upgrade command from a local copy of git repo that is sync'd to the cluster:

```bash
cd my-cluster-repo
gitops upgrade
```

A **Pull Request** will be created against your cluster repository. **Review and merge** this pull request to upgrade to Weave Gitops Enterprise.

### 5. Configure Weave Gitops Enterprise

Weave Gitops Enterprise has a number of configration options but two importants aspect to configure are:

#### 5.1. Ingress

An Ingress address is necessary in order to establish connectivity between agents and your WGE instance. The way to determine this depends on your cluster type and provisioning method.

<Tabs
  groupId="agent-ingress"
  values={[
    { label: "kind clusters", value: "kind-clusters" },
    { label: "Other cloud providers", value: "other-clusters" },
  ]}
>
  <TabItem value="kind-clusters" default>

To determine the public IP address of the worker nodes of your cluster get the local IP for kind:

```bash
export INGRESS_ADDRESS=$(ipconfig getifaddr en0)
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="other-clusters">

For other cluster providers you'll have to configure the ingress around what they provide.

```bash
export INGRESS_ADDRESS=wge.example.com
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Update the `agentTemplate.natsURL` value in the Weave Gitops Enterprise `ConfigMap` in your config repo.

#### 5.2. Git repository configuration

WGE will make pull requests against your git config repo when creating new CAPI clusters etc. The `GIT_PROVIDER_TOKEN` in the `git-provider-credentials` secret specified above will be used to authenticate.

Update the `capi.config.repositoryURL` with the correct url to your git config repository in the Weave Gitops Enterprise `ConfigMap` in git config repository itself.

:::note Restart capi-service

After configuring values in the `ConfigMap` you may have to delete the cluster-service pod for the changes to take effect.

:::

### 6. Checking that WGE is installed

You should now be able to load the WGE UI by running the following command:

```bash
$ kubectl port-forward --namespace wego-system deployments.apps/mccp-nginx-ingress-controller 8000:80
```

The WGE UI should now be accessible at `http://localhost:8000`.
