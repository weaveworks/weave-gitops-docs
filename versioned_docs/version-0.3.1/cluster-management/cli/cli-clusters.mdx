## Clusters <TierLabel tiers="enterprise" />

### Introduction

The MCCP CLI allows listing of clusters that have been created using
`CAPITemplate` resources in the terminal.

### Listing clusters

To get a list of `CAPITemplate` clusters run:

```
mccp clusters list
```

This command returns a list of all clusters that have been created using
`CAPITemplate` resources previously.

```
