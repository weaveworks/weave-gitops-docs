# Building the Weave GitOps Docs

This repo contains the documentation for Weave GitOps.  The docs uses the MKdocs framework with the MKmaterial theme. Any changes pushed to the main branch in the repo are automatically built to a [GitHub Pages website](https://weaveworks.github.io/weave-gitops-docs/).

Workflow for creating docs:

1. Write the docs in markdown
2. Build site and verify changes
3. Push changes to branch and create a PR
4. Verify changes and merge branch
5. GitHub Actions builds and deploys site

See [Mkdocs-Material theme documentation](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/reference/abbreviations/) for information on markdown formats and other supported styles.

## Install Python, MKdocs and MKdocs-Material Theme

You'll need Python 3.8 installed for MKdocs. Check if you already have python and a package manger with:

```shell
$ python --version
Python 3.8.2
$ pip --version
pip 20.0.2 from /usr/local/lib/python3.8/site-packages/pip (python 3.8)
```

It's recommended that you use [Pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) to manage Python versions on your machine.

MkDocs supports Python versions 3.5, 3.6, 3.7, 3.8, and pypy3.

`pip install --upgrade pip`

If you need to install pip for the first time, download [get-pip.py](https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py). Then run the following command to install it:

## Install Python
